My first project that is 500+ LOC
To compile, run make in project folder.
If you have the binary, open the terminal in the folder where the binary file is, type ./<binary-file-name> <game-name>
You can find games in this github repository: https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms
Make sure they are in the same folder as the binary file, so you can run them on the emulator.
